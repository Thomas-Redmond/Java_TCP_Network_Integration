# Java_TCP_Network_Integration
This projects aims to complete a task I have failed at twice now.
I aim to create a TCP network set up, and allow integration into a GUI or other application.

Previous attempts have failed at integration with the network preventing code from running on the GUI.

My method of fixing this is:

Create an input queue
Create an output queue
Create the Network code

The Network will be designed to not interact with other elements of the code directly.
The Network will instead use the input and output queues to send and recieve data to where it is needed.

This should prevent the Network "taking over" the GUI, stopping it from working.
